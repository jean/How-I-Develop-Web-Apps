Overview
========
At this point in the process, we've nailed down our general requirements, broken them
up into user stories, and generated a decent amount of documentation.

There should be very few unanswered questions at this point about what is *needed*. 

This can be enough to proceed to actually engineering the application, but 
there are many ways to achieve the same goals. There are still a few areas that 
aren't entirely clear.

Specifically, the *how* and the *way*. It's important that, although the customer
doesn't necessarily need to know specifics about how something will be built, they 
might care about what that means for the end-user experience.

It opens up discussions about phasing-in functionality that might not be as important.

But the biggest benefit of an implementation plan has to be the deliverable itself. 
In writing down your intentions you allow yourself to think more critically about
the approach, and you facilitate easy auditing -- and easier understanding of your work.
